1.ROS nodes : Launch ROS core and carry out the following tasks
  (a) List the currently running nodes
    Ans: Only "/rosout" is running
  
  (b) What is the purpose of node /rosout
    Ans:  "/rosout" subscribes to the standard /rosout topic, records these messages in a textual log file, and rebroadcasts the messages on /rosout_agg.
    
  (c) List the currently running topics
    Ans: "/rosout" and "/rosout_agg"
   
  (d) What topics are subscribed by the node /rosout
    Ans: "/rosout [unknown type]"
    
  (e) What topics are published by the node /rosout
    Ans: " /rosout_agg [rosgraph_msgs/Log]"
    
  (f) What are the services provided by the node /rosout   
    Ans: "/rosout/get_loggers" and "/rosout/set_logger_level"
    
  (g) Kill the node /rosout and again list the running nodes. What is your observation.
    Ans: Wheni killed /rosout, it showed "killing /rosout - killed". But when i tried listing rosnodes, it showed "/rosout" as running.
      
  (h) What are the functions of commands cleanup, info, kill, list, machine & ping of the rosnode command-line tool   
    Ans: rosnode cleanup	purge registration information of unreachable nodes
    rosnode info	print information about node
    rosnode kill	kill a running node
    rosnode list	list active nodes
    rosnode machine	list nodes running on a particular machine or list machines
    rosnode ping	test connectivity to node
	  
  
2.  (b) Launch rqt_graph. Save its screenshot as question2_rqt1.png Comment on your
observations from rqt_graph.
    Ans: Node "/nithik_pubnode" is publishing to "/rosout"

   (d) Comment on your observations from rqt_graph.
    Ans:3 publisher nodes "nithik_node1" is running concurrently with some numbers behind the node name
    
    
3.(b) Comment on your observations from rqt_graph.             
    Ans: Node "/nithik_node1" is publishing to "/rosout" and topic "/Greetings". Node "/RAA_subnode" is subscribing to "/Greetings" and publishing to "/rosout"
   
   
    
4.(a) List the currently running nodes
    Ans: "/CET", "/M1RAA 2024_3741_1729830984390", "/nithik_3678_1729830969200" and "/rosout" are running.
    
  (b) List the currently running topics  
    Ans:"/hello_class", "/hello_college", "/rosout", "/rosout_agg", "/welcome"

    
  (c) What is the role of the node rosout
    Ans: The "/rosout" node serves as the centralised login system for ros."/rosout" subscribes to the standard /rosout topic, records these messages in a textual log file, and rebroadcasts the messages on "/rosout_agg".
    
    
  (d) Change the name of node 2 to 'M1RAA 2024' and rerun the code. Write down any error message displayed.   
    Ans:   nodeB.py:10: UserWarning: 'M1RAA 2024_3079_1729828971326' is not a legal ROS base name. This may cause problems with other ROS tools.
  rospy.init_node('M1RAA 2024', anonymous=True)
